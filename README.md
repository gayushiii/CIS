HOW FACE RECOGNITION WORKS

Face recognition starts with building a database of relevant individuals. Retail organizations would include known organized retail criminals and shoplifters. For airports, it might be a watchlist of terrorists and fugitives wanted by Interpol. Stadiums using face recognition for event security, on the other hand, might want to keep out fans who have previously disrupted sports games or caused disturbances. While face recognition for banking might involve keeping out individuals with a history of fraud.

The next phase is matching. Cameras can be set up and optimized for angle and lighting conditions. As individuals enter a secure area, images of their faces are captured. The best picture is then matched against the database. In seconds, a feature detection system can alert security if a match occurs.

It’s these instant alerts that help security professionals actually prevent crimes from occurring. Alerts can be personalized based on the individual. For example, if a known shoplifter enters a retail superstore, the alert can simply give the directive to observe. A loss prevention professional could approach the person and offer customer service. By closely monitoring the potential criminal, they can prevent retail crime from ever occurring.

However, there are certain individuals that should not be approached. Let’s say that an individual enters a stadium and matches a person who is suspected of international terrorism. Security professionals could, be alerted to phone the police for backup.
